This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app) and structured/developed by Joel Olawanle.

For this app, we made use of next.js to create an e-commerce application that retrieves products from GraphCMS via Apollo client and queries data using GraphQL. We  also used Snipcart to easily integrate a cart system into this e-commerce application. Test it our [here](https://nextjs-ecommerce-graphcms.netlify.app/).

## Getting Started

First, clone this repository so you have my starter files, via the command below:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/olawanlejoel/nextjs-ecommerce-graphcms.git
```

...then run `npm install` to install dependencies and packages.

At this point, we can now run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the resultðŸŽ‰.
